We study **how cells adapt** at the molecular level, focusing on the process of **translation** of cellular genetic information into protein molecules. Our analyses extend from the **near-instantaneous cellular responses** to environmental stress to the **multi-million-year evolutionary divergence** of species.

Our research concentrates on **massive assembly** of proteins and RNA in response to changes in the cellular environment. We exploit our biological discoveries by **engineering self-assembling molecules** to do useful work.
