# Abstract 

Eukaryotic cells form biomolecular condensates to sense and adapt to their environment.
Poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1), a canonical stress granule marker, condenses upon heat
shock or starvation, promoting adaptation. The molecular basis of condensation has remained
elusive due to a dearth of techniques to probe structure directly in condensates. Here we apply
Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange/Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) to investigate the molecular
mechanism of Pab1’s condensation. We find that Pab1’s four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs)
undergo different levels of partial unfolding upon condensation, and the changes are similar for
thermal and pH stresses. Although structural heterogeneity is observed, the ability of MS to
describe individual populations allows us to identify which regions contribute to the condensate’s
interaction network. Our data yield a picture of Pab1’s stress-triggered condensation, which we
term sequential activation, wherein each RRM becomes activated at a temperature
where it partially unfolds and associates with other likewise activated RRMs to form the
condensate. Subsequent association is dictated more by the underlying free energy surface than
specific interactions, an effect we refer to as thermodynamic specificity. Our study represents a
methodological advance for elucidating the interactions that drive biomolecular condensation.
Furthermore, our findings demonstrate how condensation can use thermodynamic specificity to
perform an acute response to multiple stresses, a potentially general mechanism for stress-
responsive proteins.
