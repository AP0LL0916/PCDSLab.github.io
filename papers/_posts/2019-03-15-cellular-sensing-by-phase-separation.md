# Abstract 

Considerable attention has focused on how the products of phase separation act as biological compartments, bioreactors, filters, and organelles. This minireview surveys recent results demonstrating how cells instead use the process of phase separation to sense intracellular and extracellular changes. We review case studies in phase-separation-based cellular sensing, and discuss key features, such as extraordinary sensitivity, which make the process of phase separation ideally suited to solve a range of sensory challenges.
